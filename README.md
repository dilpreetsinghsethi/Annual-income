# Annual-income
The program includes a function to calculate annual salary of five employees in a small hypothetical companyâ€¦. (Company, name, and salary can be anything - all hypothetical) If the annual salary is less or equal to $25,000, the company has allocated 10.5% bonus; 11.5% bonus between $25.000 and $50.000; 12.5% bonus if more than $55,000. Bonus amounts should then be added to the annual salary to determine gross income. For salary between $50,000 and $55,000 - no bonus is added. In order to calculate "Net Annual Income" the function must ensure that government deductibles breakdowns like taxes (15.5%) and benefits (6.5%) are shown from gross income. Finally the function should print a pay stub as such (specific format is expected, with a simple print statement and output): For example: Company name: ABC Date of Pay-Stub: YYYY-MM-DD Employee: "Bill Williams" Position: "Technical Developer" Salary: $30,000 Bonus: $3.450.00 Gross Annual Income: $33,450 Deductibles: $7.359.00 Deductible (Taxes): $5,184.75 Deductible (Benefits): $2.174.25 Net Annual Income: $26,991
